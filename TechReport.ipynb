    "All the techniques mentioned above have their own problems and pitfalls, which developers face creating and applying recommender systems to real-world problems. They must be taken into account while designing system architecture, and will be covered later in this work. Though the field of recommendation itself is relatively old, there are still no solutions that work perfectly for every case. Designing and evaluating a recommender system is hard, and requires a deep understanding of domain knowledge and data available, as well as constant experimenting and modification. First recommender systems appeared long time ago in 1990's, but the intense research started quite recently with the availability of better computational power and tremendous amounts of data coming from all different sources in internet."

When terms are assigned automatically a method has to be chosen that can extract these terms from items.

Third, a learning algorithm has to be chosen that is able to learn the user profile based on seen items and can make recommendations based on this user profile.\n",

It is based on the idea that people who agreed in their evaluation of certain items in the past are likely to agree again in the future. A person who wants to see a movie for example, might ask for recommendations from friends. The recommendations of some friends who have similar interests are trusted more than recommendations from others. This information is used in the decision on which movie to see."

Making neighbourhoods too small results in not enough information for accurate prediction, and making them too big results in high computational complexity and letting noize in systems. Neighborhood size is a hyperparameter which needs to be tuned in every system. Distance between neighbors can be defined using such metrics as cosine similarity."
