The work covers both personalized and non-personalized approaches, content-based and collaborative techniques, use of matrix factorization and hybrid techniques in modern large-scale recommender systems."

They must be taken into account while designing system architecture, and will be covered later in this work. Though the field of recommendation itself is relatively old, there are still no solutions that work perfectly for every case. Designing and evaluating a recommender system is hard, and requires a deep understanding of domain knowledge and data available, as well as constant experimenting and modification."
